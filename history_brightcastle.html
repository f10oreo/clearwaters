                        <h2>History of Brightcastle</h2>
                        <p>
                            Brightcastle was built as a expansion city in the valley 
                            southwest of the Rust. It was a major port and hub for 
                            android manufacturing serving Tafota and East Providence, but 
                            was destroyed by sonic bombing during the People's Revolt. In 
                            the decades since the bombing, it has been rebuilt as the 
                            Glasslands.
                        </p>
                
                        <h3>The Glasslands</h3>
                        <p>
                            After the sonic bombs, the entire area was covered in shards 
                            of glass. Tafota decided not to rebuild the city, instead 
                            leaving the remaining inhabitants to fend for themselves. 
                            Over the decades, the glass became embedded into the grass 
                            and roadways. When looking down at the area from the 
                            mountains during certain times of the day, the city seems to 
                            disappear and reflect light as if it were part of the river 
                            it neighbors. Thus, the city was unofficially renamed to the
                            Glasslands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No longer a river port city, it is now a rest area for travellers 
                            and any who make it through the Rust. As a Bluelight 
                            District, it is considered a safe haven for cyborgs and 
                            androids who fled or were exiled from Tafota and other nearby 
                            kingdoms.
