                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        
                        <h3>The Owner</h3>
                        <p>
                            Wil Weekes is a G5 android who was commissioned 8 years ago. 
                            He was originally a factory cook who helped serve workers 
                            helping to rebuild the Glasslands. When major construction 
                            projects were completed three years after he started working, 
                            Wil moved on to open his own small restaurant in the newly 
                            reconstructed block. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Willy's in the Glasslands</h3>
                        <p>
                            Originally named Willy’s, his turquoise and orange-colored 
                            storefront became known for his rotating selection of pizzas, 
                            burgers, and stirfrys. While he regularly came up with his 
                            own signature dishes, he prided himself on keeping his menu a 
                            mystery. His logic: if customers didn’t know what to expect, 
                            they’d be more likely to return again to see what was new or 
                            if their favorite had returned. And it worked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After two years of great success, Wil decided to revise and 
                            expand the business. He put a deposit on a section of a 
                            developing retail block along the east bank of the river. He 
                            decided to keep the main floor as a restaurant and add a club 
                            venue in the basement. He had met many people moving into the 
                            Glasslands or just passing through, and wanted to give them 
                            the ability to share their talents. He hired Darius Hunter as 
                            his booker and promoter and business has been booming along 
                            the Riverwalk ever since.
