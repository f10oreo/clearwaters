                        <h2>Friends in the Community</h2>
                        <p>
                            Get to know some of our neighbors on the Riverwalk and support
                            other local businesses in the Glasslands community. Here are 
                            two businesses we think deserve a special feature!
                        </p>
                    
                        <h3>D'Cruz</h3>
                        <p>
                            The <span class="italic">Dâ€™Cruz</span> cafe is run by local 
                            pillar, Mads Weekes. Mads has been running the cafe longer 
                            than Wil has been alive and was one of the first businesses 
                            to move into the rebuilt Riverwalk blocks. The cafe is known 
                            for hosting many of the area's hobby clubs.

                        <h3>Tinker</h3>
                        <p>
                            The <span class="italic">Tinker</span> bakery is run by 
                            another long-time Glasslands resident, Minerva Weekes. Ervy 
                            helped Wil get his restaurant started when both were located 
                            in the Manyu District. Tinker gained a reputation for 
                            featuring local artists, especially android artists. Every 
                            season, they host an art gallery with a new theme.
